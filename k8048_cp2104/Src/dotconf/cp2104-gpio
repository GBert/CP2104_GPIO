# For ttyS 1us is fine

# When SLEEP is set to zero no delay is taken
# When SLEEP is less than 10, then SLEEP x I/O bit time is taken for R-PI and tty
# When SLEEP is less than 100 a busy loop is utilised
# When SLEEP is >=100 then system usleep is used.
#
# For GPIO BIT-BANG SLEEP configures the low and high clock durations in the driver

# I/O bit rules.
#       These rules determine the polarity of the control lines and whether
#       data input requires data output pulled high.
